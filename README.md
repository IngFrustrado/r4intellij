R Language support for Intellij IDEA
====================================


This project provides an integration of R, which is a language for statistical computing and graphics, into [Intellij IDEA](http://jetbrains.com). It aims to bring the best language for data mining and modeling in touch with the best IDE. 

For documentation and installation instructions see our **[project website](http://holgerbrandl.github.io/r4intellij)**

**This project has reached a somewhat stable, usable state but *is no longer* being actively *developed*. It has been superceded by <https://github.com/JetBrains/Rplugin> which provides a much richer set of features, including better console & graphics integration, a working debugger, Rmarkdown support and advanced coding assistance.**

Acknowledgements
----------------


This project was rebuilt by merging its codebase with a fork of [The R plugin](https://github.com/ktisha/TheRPlugin). So most credits go to go [ktisha](https://github.com/ktisha).
  
This project would not have been possible without the great [bash plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4230?pr=phpStorm) which inspired us a lot when getting started with r4intellij, and from which we borrowed also some code.
